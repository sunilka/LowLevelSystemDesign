- Observer desgin pattern is a behavioural design pattern.
- In the observer design pattern, we would have an publisher or event emiiter that would emit events to its subscribers.
- Hence this design pattern is also called as event subscriber design pattern. You can also call this as listener design pattern.
- For the practice purpose, we would have an editor (publisher) that would emit events to the subscribers. The subscribers would listen for the events of the file open and save.
