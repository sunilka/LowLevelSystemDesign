- Low level design is used to design application in a way that the code is extensible, re-usebale, and readable.
- SOLID principles form the base of the low level design principles.

**SOLID principles**

- S -> Single responsibility principle.
Single responsibility principle says that the a class should have only one reason for change.

- O -> Open for extension/ Closed for modification.
Open/Closed priciple says that a class should be open for extension, but it should be closed for modification.

- L -> Liskov's substitution principle:
Liskov's substitution principle says that if a A is a parent class and B is child class, you should be able to replace the obejct of B with A and code should work without any breakages.

- I -> Interface segregation principle:
Interface segregation principle says that a client must not be forced to implement a method that it does not use. 

- D -> Dependency Inversion principle:
Dependency Inversion principle says that class should depend on interfaces and not on concrete classes.

There are 3 different categories in which the design patterns fall into:

1) Creational design pattern.
2) Structural design pattern.
3) Behavioural desgin pattern.

1) Creational design pattern:
In the creational design pattern, we focus on how to create objects. Some of the creational design patterns are:
    - Singleton design pattern.
    - Factory design pattern.
    - Abstract factory design pattern.

2) Structural design pattern:
In the structural design pattern, we focus on how to organize the class and objects. Some of the structural design patterns are:
    - Adapter design pattern.
    - Decorator design pattern.
   

3) Behavioural design pattern:
In the observer design pattern, we focus on the behaviour or the algorithms that an object would perform and also the communication between the objects. Some of the behaviourl design pattern are:
    - Observer Design pattern.
    - Strategy design pattern.
