- Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational design pattern.
- The abstract factory design pattern is also called as factory of factory design pattern.
- The abstract factory design pattern is used when we have to create objects based on cretain conditions.
- In the abstract factory design pattern we will be grouping the objects with some common similarites into one factory and sother objects with differences are gouped under their own factory. 
- There would be a common factory that would again host these factories in them.
- To practice the abstract factory, we will implement a GUI factory that would give us buttons and checkboxes. There would be two families of these buttons, namely Windows button and the Mac OS buttons.
- We would have a factory that would give us the Windows buttons and a factory that would give the Mac OS buttons.
