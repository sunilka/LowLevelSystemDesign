- Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern.
- Singleton is the most easiest desgin pattern.
- In the singleton desgin pattern we can create only one instance of the singleton class.
- In the singleton class the constructor is made as priavte so that we are not able to create the object of that class anywhere else.
- The private constructor would be static and also the variable that would hold the object would also be static.
- To make the method of generating the object thread safe we would use the "syncronized" keyword with the function definition.
- An example code for the singleton desgin pattern is shown.
